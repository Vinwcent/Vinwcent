Hi, I'm Vinwcent, an ESPCI student in Mathematics/Physics. I'm passionated about creating AI algorithms and games based on them. You should begin to see more and more deep learning algorithm project in the next months. Currently working on a surface detection U-net neural network thanks to fringe profilometry !

I'll restart working on the almost finished RTS game so feel free to finish it before if you want !
