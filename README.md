Hi, I'm Vinwcent, an ESPCI student. I'm passionated about creating AI algorithms and games based on them.
I'm currently creating a game with a few AI called Carrot Society that I began in March 2022, it will be a commercial project that I will release in December/January on the Appstore that's why the source code is not available (if you want a testflight code contact me !)

For those who came to look at the RTS game, you can use and edit it freely, I don't know when I will work on it again.

Have fun !
