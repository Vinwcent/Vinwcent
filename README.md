Hi, I'm Vinwcent, an ESPCI student. I'm passionated about creating AI algorithms and games based on them.
Carrot Society and Punchit are two commercial games I made which are available on the Appstore.

Currently working on a Hive RL agent that should be available here in April/May.

PS: For those who came to look at the RTS game, you can use and edit it freely, the development is paused and I would be happy to see what you'll do with it !

Have fun !
